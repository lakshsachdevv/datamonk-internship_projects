##Answer 1

Linux provides multiple help systems because different tools serve different types of commands:

man (manual pages): For full documentation of external programs (like ls, find, tar).

--help: A quick summary of options for a command-line tool (only works with external commands that support it).

help: Built-in help for shell built-in commands (like cd, echo, exit in bash).

help is the only correct choice when you're looking for help with a shell built-in command, e.g.:




##Answer 2
find is more powerful when you want to:

Search in nested folders.

Use advanced criteria (like modified time, file type).

Do actions (e.g. delete, exec).

Use ls | grep only when you're scanning the current folder.

##Answer 3
You can use:


history | grep keyword
Example: To find when you used scp last week:


history | grep scp
This shows all previous commands matching the keyword, including timestamps if enabled.
To enable timestamps in history:


export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "
Then history will show date & time too.

##Answer 4
.tar.gz is used 

It's native to Unix/Linux, so:

Preserves file permissions, symbolic links, ownership.

More efficient compression on large files.

Commonly used in Linux workflows and package managers.
